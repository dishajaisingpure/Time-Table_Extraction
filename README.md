# Time-Table_Extraction
This program is used to extract and make the weekly timetable of a particular teacher from multiple weekly standard-wise workbooks that had division-wise timetable worksheets.
## Description
The input excel file consists of division-wise timetable worksheets. The timetable consists of the lectures to be conducted for that division during that week. It also has the name of the teacher conducting the lectures. The output excel file should contain a consolidated timetable for a specific teacher which is sorted date-wise and then time-wise.
## About
For this project, I have used Python3 for coding along with internal code documentation.
## Contents
The uploaded folder consists of a code file named Time-Table_Extraction.py
## Requirements
Apart from Python3, you will need the following libraries:
1) pandas - This package is used to deal with data structures, data manipulation and analysis.
2) glob - This package is used to retrive the files/pathnames matching a specified pattern.
3) xlrd - This package is used to deal with excel file and its functions such as reading and writing into a file.
4) openpyxl - This package is also used to deal with reading and writing excel files. It also offers features of excel which the native package lack.
